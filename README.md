### Abstract

This project is a **backend system for a ride-sharing platform** that enables users to book rides, register as drivers, and manage ride details. It is built using **Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB**, following a structured MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. The system ensures seamless ride-sharing experiences, secure authentication, and efficient database management.

Ride-sharing applications help reduce traffic congestion, lower transportation costs, and promote eco-friendly commuting. This backend system provides a **secure and scalable** platform for managing user authentication, ride creation, driver registrations, and booking functionalities.
